Code to accompany experiments in Covington & Miller (2025): "A powerful goodness-of-fit test using the probability integral transform of order statistics"

`gof_statistics.jl`: helper file containing goodness-of-fit tests
`null_distributions.jl`: creates figures showing distributions of p-values under the null
`power_calculations.jl`: creates figures showing power of different tests across various alternatives

All figures save to a `results` sub-directory placed in the current directory.
